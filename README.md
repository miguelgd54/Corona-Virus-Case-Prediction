# Corona Virus Case Prediction
This project does a simple exponential prediction analysis on the Corona Virus (COVID-19) number of cases in the United States.
The way this is accomplished is by doing a polynomial curve fitting. Data is from the worldometer website using all the data since February 15th until March 27th, then the cases for the next 14 days get predicted.

As expected, the predictions were off by a lot and they were not accurate in the long run. However, this was an interesting side project to be able to visualize how exponential growth can be scary for uncontrolled diseases, and to visualize what could've happened if the fatality rate, and the strength of the virus to spread was higher than what it is now.As of today, August 31st, the virus does not seem to be as contagious as they thought back in March or February. This project shows how the spread could've been if the virus was more contagious.
